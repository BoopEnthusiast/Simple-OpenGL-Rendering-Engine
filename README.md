# Simple OpenGL renderer
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A large portion of the code is from various sources other than myself:
Initial window from glfw example code: https://www.glfw.org/documentation.html
To help learn the beginnings I followed The Cherno's OpenGL series on youtube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2&si=u6WYzXmiBVdamIYa
Also used a bit of the glew example code: https://glew.sourceforge.net/basic.html
